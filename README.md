# React + TypeScript + Vite

```js
   To get started

   cd into the this enclosing directory
   npm i (or npm install / yarn install)
   npm run dev

- Notes

- I'd have componetised more items given more time - rather than bundle everything into one app.js and one index.css file

- There's a couple of quick fixes in the css for some simple alignment - not exactly production ready

- Given the simplicity of the task I decided not to go down the SCSS/SASS route
